📫 How to reach me: --> https://www.linkedin.com/in/yash-dixit-035b662b3/
I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Structures & Algorithms. My journey into the world of tech began with a curiosity for how things work behind the scenes, which gradually evolved into a deep interest in solving complex problems using code. As I explored various domains, I found myself particularly drawn to AIML for its potential to build intelligent systems, and DSA for the elegance and efficiency it brings to problem-solving.

Over time, working on hands-on projects and diving deeper into machine learning models, algorithms, and optimization techniques has only fueled my enthusiasm further. I’m always eager to learn more, refine my skills, and stay updated with emerging trends.

Lately, I’ve also started exploring the world of blockchain and decentralized systems — a space that fascinates me with its innovation and potential for disruption. While I’m still in the early stages, I’m excited about where this exploration could lead.

I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful tech-driven solutions.
